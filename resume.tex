{\bf{Associate Software Engineer}}, iRobot Corp. \hfill July 2017 - present \\ 
Developed embedded Linux application that run on ARM SoC to autonomously control mobile robots. Modelled safe and robust behaviours using finite state machine. Wrote algorithms that leverage sensor data to help robots respond to changes in physical environment. Implemented features that serializes robotsâ€™ internal states for communication with cloud sice IoT stack, to enable multi-robot collaboration. Oversaw the cross-team software development of the next generation Bravva Jet$^{\tiny{\textregistered}}$ robotic mops. Participated in regular triage, planning, code review and other release activities. Participated in the conceptualization of future generation of deep learning powered robotic vacuum cleaners.

{\bf{Robotics Engineering Intern}}, CloudMinds Inc. \hfill May 2016 - Aug 2016 \\
Used Kinect and RealSense depth cameras to incorporate visual feedback into the control and motion planning of an ABB YuMi$^{\tiny{\textregistered}}$ industrial robot. Implemented CUDA-accelerated object detection, localization and tracking routines in C++ and Python using regional convolutional neural networks and correlation trackers. Experimented with dense visual SLAM using depth cameras and mobile robot base.

% SKILL ---------------------------------------------------
\begin{rSection}{PROJECTS}
{\bf{Autonomous Racecar Driving}}, class project for \emph{Intro to Deep Neural Networks}, WPI \hfill Apr 2017 \\
Trained a neural network agent that plays a racing simulation game using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. Designed cost and reward functions, training scheme and regularization techniques. Implemented forward propagation in TensorFlow and Keras. Resulting agent outperforms expert human players, achiving top speed of 180 km/h in simulation.

{\bf{SLAM with TurtleBot}}, class project for \emph{Unified Robotics IV}, WPI \hfill Oct - Dec 2015 \\
Worked in a team of three students to implement simultaneous localization and mapping on a TurtleBot. Developed Python programs in Linux using the Robot Operating System to drive the robot and detect obstacles. Implemented path planning using A-Star algorithm. Designed frontier exploration techniques and RViz visualizations for the mapping process. Consistently and successfully mapped an unknown environment.
